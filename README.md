Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a medical test used to measure the electrical activity of the brain. In some cases, EEG can be used to detect the presence of a stroke by identifying changes in the brain's electrical activity. However, it's important to note that EEG is not a reliable diagnostic tool for stroke and should not be used as the sole method for determining if someone has had a stroke.

EEG is often used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans, to help diagnose a stroke. The EEG signal can provide information about the brain's electrical activity and help distinguish between different types of strokes. For example, in some cases, EEG can detect the presence of seizures, which are a common complication of certain types of strokes.
